# Youtube-Clone

# Introduction to our project (https://youtube-x1.netlify.app/):
YouTube is an American online video sharing and social media platform headquartered in San Bruno, California. It was launched on February 14, 2005, by Steve Chen, Chad Hurley, and Jawed Karim. Owned by Google, it is the second most visited website, right after Google itself. 

# Collaborations
There are no collaborations in this project. I took it upon myself to make a youtube clone as close to the original as possible. I think I did a good job since the frontend is not really my main domain. 

# Tech Stack Used
I used HTML, CSS, Javascript and Bootstrap to create this website. I also used the API provided by the google.
